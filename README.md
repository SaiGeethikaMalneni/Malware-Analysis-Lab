# Malware-Analysis-Lab

## Overview

Malware Analysis Lab is a comprehensive guide and set of instructions for setting up a secure environment to analyze malware samples. The goal is to determine the functionality, origin, and potential impact of given malware samples. The project covers both static and dynamic analysis approaches, providing detailed steps and tools for each.

## Types of Malware Analysis

### Static Analysis
Static analysis involves studying the behavior of malware without executing it. This includes examining file types, hash values, strings, packing, and PE headers.

### Dynamic Analysis
Dynamic analysis involves studying the behavior of malware while it is executed. This includes observing process activities, network activities, registry activities, and file activities.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to set up your Malware Analysis Lab:

### Step 1: Installing VirtualBox and Windows ISO Image

1. Download [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and install it.
2. Download [Windows ISO](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/software-download/windows10).
3. Set up a new virtual machine in VirtualBox with the provided specifications.

### Step 2: Configuring VM

1. Disable Windows Update and Windows Defender.
2. Disable hiding file extensions and take a snapshot for backup.

### Step 3: Flare-VM Installation

1. Change virtual machine settings for requirements.
2. Install Flare-VM by following the provided [installation guide](https://github.com/mandiant/flare-vm).

### Step 4: Static Malware Analysis

1. Download malware samples from sources like theZoo, Inquest, virusShare, etc.
2. Identify file type, hash value, and strings using tools like HxD and HashMyFiles.
3. Check for packing using ExeInfo and analyze PE headers with PEstudio.

### Step 5: Dynamic Malware Analysis

1. Set up tools such as Wireshark, Regshot, and Procmon.
2. Capture network activities, registry activities, and file activities while executing malware.
